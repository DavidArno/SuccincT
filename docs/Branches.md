## Succinc\<T\> Active branches ##
Currently, there are two active branches: `v3.3` and `v4.0`

All other branches are no longer used (or, in the case of `master`, not used directly), should not be used for pull requests.

### master branch ###
This is the branch from which releases are made (with the exception to v2.2.0, which was released from a now-retired branch, `serialization`). Please do not submit PR's directly against this branch.

### v3.3 branch ###
If you wish to commit a PR, please target this branch.

This branch is currently only compatible with VS2017.3+ (C# 7.1+).

### v4.0 branch ###
This branch contains incomplete work, ideas and general random changes that may make it into v4.0.

This branch is currently only compatible with VS2017.7+ (C# 7.3+).
